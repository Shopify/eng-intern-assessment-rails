# About
- This is the technical challenge portion for the backend developer internship position at Shopify.
- This project is an Encyclopedia where users can perform the basic CRUD functionalities on the site.

# Changes made
- In order to complete the project the following changes were made:
  - Model for the Article was added
  - Index, show, edit, and update views were added
  - Article controller was added
  - Styling was added to different components
  - Ruby version was changed to 3.3.0

# Result
- This implementation passes all the tests that were integrated

# Improvements
- Due to my workload from work and school, I was not able to spend much time on this project. However, if I had time I would make the following changes to the project:
  - Integrate Bootstrap for styling: Even though I tried to get it working, it did not work properly
  - Improve UI: As of now, the page is very plain and not user friendly therefore improving the UI will improve the user experience
  - Search result display: I would use a list to display the matching article right below the search bar and allow the user to click on it
 
# Notes
- Thank you so much for your time and consideration, this project was a good learning project for me to get familiar with Ruby on Rails.
