# Engineering Intern Challenge: Shopify Backend 

## Challenge Overview
- Encyclopedia app that can create, read, update and delete various articles 
- There is a search functionality to find things by title and content (it will not search by author, but this an easy addition)
## Assumptions
- When there is no search term there should be all articles presented to the user 
- Users won't be entering empty strings/duplicate article articles are allowed (didn't add the uniqueness parameter)
- This encyclopedia is completely open, no login functionality is required!

## My Experience
- I found this to be a great learning experience, haven't had any chance to work with Ruby in any sense, and this was a breath of fresh air for learning something I honestly found quite challenging. I want to thank you guys for avoiding the route of a traditional OA that most companies offer, as regardless of the outcome I gained some new cool schools and insight into Ruby on Rails and all of the development that can be done with it! Thank you all for the opportunity!

# Instructions
- You must run a bin/rails db:migrate
- I was unable to get rspec functioning, but was able to run my tests through bundle exec rails test test/models/article_test.rb
