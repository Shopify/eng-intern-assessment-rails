# BENNY GOLDMAN's EncyCRUDpedia

This was a fun challenge to build a basic CRUD app with Rails. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

## Goals met

- [x] Review Existing Tests

- [x] Implement Functionality
  - [x] generated `Article` model with schema and validation
  - [x] generated `Articles` controller to handle requests and perform actions
  - [x] created views to perform `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` actions in-browser.

- [x] Ensure Code Quality
  - [x] used `rubocop` gem to format code to Ruby on Rails conventions

- [x] Test Your Code
  - [x] ran tests and fixed failures to ensure all pass

- [x] Code Documentation
  - [x] added clean, easy-to-understand comments for all new files

- [x] Version Control
  - [x] committed after all milestones

- [ ] Create a Pull Request: Once you have completed the project goals, create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes made and any relevant information for the code review.
