## Overview

This application serves as a digital encyclopedia for articles, capturing the article content, date published, title, and author. The application also allows for Create, Read, Update, Destroy (CRUD) operations on the articles, as well as a search functionality.

## Added Functionality

I have added the following functionality to this project:

 **1. CRUD Operations**

This application allows for CRUD operations on the articles. The user can create, read, update, and destroy articles. The user can also view all articles in the database.

 **2. Article Search**
 
This application also allows for searching of articles by title. The user can search for articles by title, and the application will return a list of articles that contain the search query in their titles.

## Starting the Application

To start the application, run the following commands:

```
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails server
```
