- Reusable and matainable code
- Comment and documentation to aid understanding
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive unit tests to ensure high code coverage

2. `git clone` the repo to local machine
3. Run `bundle install` to install all the dependencies
4. Run `rails db:migrate`
5. Run `rails server`
6. Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the UI
7. To run tests, run `rails test`
