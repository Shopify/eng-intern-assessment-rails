# Encyclopedia 

This is a functional encyclopedia build with ruby on rails!
You can create, delete, and update articles by navigating around the website,
and you can even search through articles from the search page!

# Running instructions

*assuming you have ruby 3.2.3, rails, and the bundle gem installed*

run ```bundle install``` in the project directory

once complete run ```rails s```

this will start a rails server, open up the website (possibly at localhost:3000)

enjoy the amazing encyclopedia
